# IPT Smart Campus - Dashboard App

This is the dashboard application / prototype to demonstrate some of the concepts we aim to achieve with the full SmartCampus prototype one day.

This is part of the SmartCampus Ci2 Internal Research Project.

## Launching the Dashboard App

This is a simple react application (SPA), thus can be launched normally with simple steps, such as `node install && npm start` or `react-scripts start` (check package.json)
